Q)When we logged into the cloud account by default why do we always jump into the north virginia region, why itâ€™s most popular ?
It is the first region started by aws. It is most popular because it has highest az's whose count is 6.
This makes him highly available and every new updates comes firstly to this region thats why its is most popular.

Q)What are ebs volumes and its types?
EBS is elastic block storage used in aws cloud to store data.Types:-general purpose ssd volume (gp2,gp3), provisioned iops ssd volumes, throughput optimized,cold hdd, magnetic
Purpose of using ebs volume?they are n/w attached storage.
They are in forms of single single blocks which makes them in faster in terms of processing speed,Ebs volumes attached at launch of instance get deleted automatically after instance is deleted.

Q)Purchasing options in ec2?
    On-Demand:-Launch instance whenever you want and Pay as per second according to your need
    Spot Instance:-there are some unused instances which are available in aws use them accordinly in lows cost.
    Reserved Instance:-here user or organization make commitment to user in short aggrement is signed for specific configuration including region and instance type for 1-3 years.
    Dedicated Host:-here user pay for dedicated host means a special block of server is alloted to him where he can bring his existing socket,core or vms to reduce cost.
    Dedicated Instace:-Single tenant h/w is present where we pay for per hours.
    Saving Plans:-Aggrement is signed for cosistent amount of usage in usd per hr for 1-3 yrs.

Q)Differnce between ami image and template?
AMI image is collection of various application that are used to creata workspace
Template is collection of various setting or configuration used to create workspace

Q)What is nic and its typpe?
NIC is network interface card which connects device to internet.
Types :- Wired NIC and Wireless NIC

Q)What is elastic IP?Why and where we use it?
Elastic IP is static IPV4 ip designed for dynamic cloud computing.It doesnt get changes over period of time.It comes from amazon IPV4 addresses pool or custom IPV4 pool.
When we associate elastic ip to instance it also get associated with instance network interface.Helps to connect with internet.Used in specific region only and cannot be used in another region.

Q)What is snapshot?Why we use it?
Snapshot is backup of instance.From snapshot we can create image and volume.We can take snapshot of whole instance also and of particular volume attached to instance also.

Q)Difference Between nacl and security groups?
security group:-associated with instance
we can only allow ports we cannot deny specific ports
it is stateful means changes made in inbound will directly reflected to outbound rule
it is first layer of defence

nacl:-associated with subnet
we can specify allow and deny of ports
it is stateless means changes made in inbound rule doest not get reflected in outbound rule
it is second layer of defence

Q)How many IP Addresses can we attach to the instances ?
we can assign multiple ipv6 ips

Q)How many types of volume states do we have ?
Available and in-use

Q)What is key pair and its types?
Key pair is set of credentials we use to prove our identity while connecting to instance
key-pair type:-RSA & ED25519(only support mac and linux)
Public key:-Amazon EC2 stores 
Private key:-User stores

Q)What is load balancer and its types ?
Load balancing is the method of distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources that support an application.
Provides single point of contact for user on internet
Types:-Classic LB, Application LB, Network LB, Gateway LB

Q)How does the load balancer work in the backend? Can you explain it ?
Load balancer is created and basic conf is done. Where internet facing scheme is given to maki it available in public.Where VPC's az's security group and listeners and routing is added and path of project is added.After adding aal these conf we add instances and then creates LB. Conf changes according to type of project,webserver etc. After creating load balancer we get one link called and DNS which makes our project aaccesible from internet.

Q)Features of Load Balancers ?
Works on Round-Robin algorithm.
helps yo distribute users on servers.
keeps cpu utilization normal.
prevent server crash by distributing load.
 
Q)What is ASG ? & Its types ?
ASG ia resource of EC2 provided by AWS.Launched using aws template. Where threshold values are added and according to that threshold value it scales up and scales down in terms of insatnaces with same conf and same data.


Q)What is a Health Check ?
Health checks are related to target group where we add our instances for target path to navigate to our project path which we are going to make live. If the path is wrong then it states unhealthy and if everything goes well then it returns code 200 which is healthy.

Q)What is the threshold ?
Threshold is a limit whic we applies on CPU utilization once it crosses threshold limit asg comes into the ground and starts scaling up servers.


Q)What is the group of LB ?
Groups of LB defines to the path of directory where multiple webpages are stored and it works simulatneously with LB when we mentions path is front of DNS in url.

Q)Why do we prefer ALB over CLB ?
ALB is new generation load balancer where CLB is previous generation load balancer.
ALB works using target group which makes easier for load distributin where in CLB target group doesnt play any role.


Q)Difference between Web server & Application server ?
Web-Server:-server statis web site
	basic session management
	implements security on serving content
	scales well for static content serving
	eg. apache http server, nginx
	dont execute application code

App-Server:-serves dynamic website
	advanced session management
	implements security for application level
	scales well for dynamic content
	eg. apache tomcat , microsoft iis
	execute application code.

Q)What is the target group ?
Groups of LB defines to the path of directory where multiple webpages are stored and it works simulatneously with LB when we mentions path is front of DNS in url.

Q)What is the desired capacity in ASG ?
Desired capacity means how much servers we want to launch.

Q)How many types of the Scaling option ?
Scaling plans ?

Q)Types Auto scaling
HORIZONTAL Scaling and Vertical Scaling

Q)Difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling ?
Vertical Scaling:- Also known as "scaling up."
	Involves increasing the capacity of a single machine by adding more resources, such as CPU, RAM, or storage, to the existing hardware.
	Typically requires upgrading to a more powerful machine, often with more processing power, memory, or storage capacity.
	Vertical scaling can be limited by the maximum capacity of a single machine.
	Generally, it is more straightforward to implement as it doesn't require changes to the application architecture to run on multiple machines.

Horizontal Scaling:-Also known as "scaling out."
	Involves adding more machines or nodes to a distributed system.
	Each new machine added is typically identical to existing machines.
	Distributes the load across multiple machines, making it possible to handle increased traffic or workload.
	Provides better fault tolerance, as the failure of one machine doesn't bring down the entire system.
	Can be more cost-effective in terms of hardware, as commodity hardware can be used 

Q)Difference between AMI & Snapshot ?
Amazon Machine Image (AMI):An AMI is a pre-configured virtual machine image that contains the necessary information to launch an instance (virtual server) in the cloud.
	It includes the operating system, application server, and any additional software required to run an application.
	AMIs are used to create instances in the cloud. When you launch an instance from an AMI, you get a running virtual server with the specific configuration captured in the AMI.
	AMIs can be public (shared with the community) or private (customized for specific use within an organization).

Snapshot:A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of the data stored on an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume.
	EBS volumes are used as storage for EC2 instances in AWS, and snapshots are a way to back up the data on these volumes.
	Snapshots are incremental, meaning that only the data that has changed since the last snapshot is copied. 
	This helps in optimizing storage costs and time required to create snapshots.
	Snapshots can be used to create new volumes, restore volumes to a previous state, or migrate volumes across regions.


Q)What is difference between EBS/EFS/S3
EBS:- Elastic block storage
	Data is stored in blocks.Data is present in structured manner which helps to maintain data.Oftenly O.S are stored in ebs.

EFS:- Elastic file system
	Elastic file system is used to store files on mounted directory.Used to give access for multiple user to access same file as it supports NFSv4.

S3:-Simple Storage Service
	Known as object level storage. Each object stored in s3 gets unique id. We can store various type of data like images , videos , txt files etc. Suitable for static website hosting , backup and restore.
