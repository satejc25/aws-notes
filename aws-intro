Q1)What is cloud computing ?
---->Cloud refers to remote webservers in which various data centers that host databases and run application code.
Process data from server.
Access data or application via internet from any region.

Q2)Deployment model in cloud?
---->There are total three types of deployment model in cloud {Public Cloud , Private Cloud , Hybrid Cloud}
1)Public Cloud-->1)Available to everyone on internet.
               2)Operated on pay as per use model.
               3)Managed by third party i.e clod provider.
               4)Same storage is used by multiple user at same time.
          Adv--->it has low cost because it shares memory.
                 it is scalable(easy to add and remove) and reliable(24*7 available)
          Disadv --->performance depends on speed of internet
                     low security

2)Private Cloud -->1)Known as internal cloud or corporate cloud.
                 2)provides computing services to private internal network and selected user within organization.
                 3)provides high level of security and privacy using firewall and internal hosting
                 4)hp-data center , elastra private cloud , ubuntu are some example.
         Adv---->more control that is accessed by specific user
                 more secure
                 improved performance
        disadv-->high cost
                 restrict area of operation
                 require skilled people to handle it.

3)Hybrid Cloud-->1)Combination of public cloud and private cloud.
                 2)main moto is to create unified ,automated and well managed computing environment.
                 3)in hybrid cloud non critical activity is performed by public cloud and critical activity is performed by private cloud.
                 4)used in healthcare ,finance,univrsities
         Adv---->secure
                 flexible
                 cost effective
                 risk management
        disavd---->network issue
                   infrastructure compatibility.

Q3)Service model in cloud?
---->There are three types of service model  {IaaS , PaaS , SaaS}
1)SaaS--->1)Software as a Service
          2)Delivering application over internet as a service.
          3)Accessing software over internet as a application.
          4)multi-tenant architecture -shares common infrastructure which help to improve code centrally.
          5)Better access from n/w device.
            e.g. gmail by google
  features-->flexible
             cost effectiveness
             frequent automatic updates
             accessible from anywhere.

2)Paas---->1)Platform as a Service.
           2)Offer flexible , scalable cloud platform to develope deploy and run and manage apps.
           3)Everything is provided from cloud provider right from network ,server ,os,virtulization,middleware,runtime.
           4)user has to manage only application and data.
           5)provides platform to create application and put it into cloud where other user can access it.
